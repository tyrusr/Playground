# Playground

Playground is a personal MERN sandbox used for repetition, drills, and experimentation across frontend and backend concepts.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Drill and reinforce known concepts through repetition
- Experiment with new tools and techniques before using them in production
- Practice writing code from memory to internalize patterns
- Safely test ideas without impacting portfolio or production projects

Code in this repository is frequently added, removed, and rewritten by design.

## Areas of Practice

### Frontend
- React components and hooks
- State management patterns
- Forms and controlled inputs
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Styling experiments (Tailwind, Bootstrap)
- Framework exploration (e.g. Next.js)

### Backend
- Express routes, controllers, and middleware
- Authentication and authorization (JWT, CSRF)
- Password hashing and salting
- Input validation and sanitization
- File handling and sandboxing
- Security middleware (Helmet, etc.)
- Performance optimizations (compression, pagination)

### Testing & Tooling
- Unit and integration testing
- API testing
- Validation libraries
- Performance and security experiments

## Notes

- This is not a portfolio project
- There is no stable feature set
- Structure and code quality may change frequently
- The focus is learning, speed, and pattern mastery
